 Material for the workshops organized at FEM in collaboration with UniMore
 
Data Science & Me is a free introductory course to R programming and Data Science for the UniMoRe students. The lessons will be hosted at FEM - Future Education Modena.

These first 4 meetings are a first introduction to the world of Data Science for students from different backgrounds, also to understand how to use (and exploit) data and numbers in many professional fields.

The course will be held in English.

The themes and dates of the lessons are:

- Data Visualization (4/02)

- Data Transformation (6/02)

- Model Building (11/02)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (13/02)

Data Science & Me is designed to make students work on real cases from the beginning, guided by a dedicated tutor; extra material will also be shared to allow the students to learn on their own .

It is recommended to bring your own computer; laptops can be made available on request for those who need them.
